# TranscriptHomies:

In transcriptomic data, changes in one gene’s expression may lead to coordinated shifts in others. However, exploring these correlations manually is time-consuming and not easily scalable across multiple datasets. This project aims to build a tool that identifies and visualizes gene–gene expression correlations between two biological groups (e.g., diseased vs. normal samples).

Proposed Programming Solution

Data processing: Implement code to import two gene expression matrices, align shared genes, and normalize expression values.
Correlation analysis: Compute pairwise correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman) for each gene across samples within each group.
Interactive query: Allow the user to input one gene of interest and retrieve all genes significantly correlated with it in either group.
Visualization: Generate heatmaps and correlation networks highlighting the strength and direction of correlations.
Overview of Implementation

Stages/components: (1) Data input & preprocessing, (2) Correlation computation, (3) Statistical filtering, (4) Visualization, (5) Optional user interface (command line or simple web app).
How code solves the problem: Automates identification of co-expressed gene sets
Desired inputs: Two gene expression tables (CSV or TSV) with genes as rows and samples as columns.
Desired outputs: Correlation matrix files, ranked lists of correlated genes, and visual outputs (heatmaps, scatterplots, or network diagrams).
Potential challenges: Handling missing data, large-scale computation efficiency, and false-positive correlations due to sample size.
Anticipated programming concepts:
Logic & control flow: Conditional statements and loops for iterative correlation testing.
Data structures: Data frames, dictionaries, and matrices for organizing expression data.
Modules: Use of pandas/numpy (Python) or tidyverse (R) for data manipulation and matplotlib/ggplot2for visualization.
Algorithms: Implementation of correlation and multiple-testing correction algorithms (e.g., Bonferroni or FDR).
